      <h3>Advanced help</h3>
      <p>
        There are basically two modes of operation for this app.
        <ul>
          <li><b>Convenient</b>: keep the project brief data on the server. 
          Downloading can be done any time, but would only serve backup purposes.</li>
          <li><b>Secure</b>: upload and download the project brief data when editing or viewing is needed. 
          Make sure to remove the data from the server, once it has been successfully downloaded.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>Technical details</h3>
      <p>
        This implementation of the project 'brief' is a Django app under the larger 'Cesar' web application.
        The source code of Cesar is available at <a href="https://github.com/ErwinKomen/RU-cesar">github</a>.
        The 'brief' source code can be found in there.
        The 'brief' also makes use of the 'basic' app (providing the standardized list view and details view)
