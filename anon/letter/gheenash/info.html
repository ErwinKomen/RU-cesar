        <h1>More Information</h1>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>These stories are taken from the book "Бераллин гІенаш", written by Musa Kilabovich Arsanukaev 
        (see <a href="https://www.grozny-inform.ru/news/culture/77769/">announcement (Russian)</a>). 
        The stories in Бераллин гІенаш provide a vivid cultural and historical picture of the Chechen life as it was decades ago.
        The native Chechen readers can learn a lot about their own culture and history from these anecdotes.
        They provide a number of useful words and concepts within a natural setting, facilitating the readers to keep up with their language.
        This is particularly important in a time and age where Russian takes up a huge part of life in the native country, 
        while languages such as German, French, English and even Dutch become the second (or third) language of the younger diasporar communities.</p>

        <h3>HELP!</h3>
        <p>Are you interested in helping out with the draft translation of the stories (from Chechen into English or Dutch) 
        or the brushing-up of the results (to make for natural translations)? Then please contact us (see below at 'contact').</p>

        <h3>Language study</h3>
        <p>Interested inChechen? Here is some material available for learning Chechen:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="../elpash.html">Elpash</a>: learn the basics one letter at a time. The lessons are in English, there are exercises (with an answer sheet),
            and the stories (one per letter) come with a sound recording. This course is completely ready and available online.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="../gulam.html">Gulam</a>: this is an audio-focused 'comprehensible corpus'. A collection of audio-exercises 
            that focuses on: vocabulary learning (by pointing to items), physical response drills, grammar learning 
            (by taking one grammatical feature and applying it to multiple pictures in a picture book) and comprehensible-input stories.
            All the spoken text is also (becoming) available transcribed into (Cyrillic) Chechen, sometimes with accompanying IPA, where this is helpful.
            This series is under construction, since the transcription takes some time.
          </li>
          <li><b>Orthography</b>: This <a href="../che/ChechenOrthography.pdf">pdf</a> 
            explains the correspondence between the Chechen Cyrillic orthography and the Latin one that is used in e.g. the dictionary app.
            (If you're interested, this <a href="../che/ChechenPhonologyChapter.pdf">pdf</a> contains the whole chapter on Chechen phonology - preliminary version.)
          </li>
          <li><b>Dictionary</b>
            <ul>

            <b>Keyboard</b>:
            Here is the <a href="../che/TheChechenR_keyboard.pdf">pdf description</a> of an adapted <b>Russian</b> keyboard.
            This keyboard can be installed by downloading the <a href="../che/chechenr.zip">compressed file</a>, unpacking it into a folder, and then double-clicking the <b>setup.exe</b> file.
            (You might want to first check it for viruses, since this is an executable.)
            If setup fails for some reason, it may still be possible to attempt a setup by using one of the three <code>.msi</code> files 
            (only one will be appropriate for your computer).
            <p>Note: you will be asked to confirm this installation as administrator by your computer.</p>
