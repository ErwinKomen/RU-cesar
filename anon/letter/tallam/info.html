        <p>When doing research on the Chechen language, several things caught my attention. 
        I've done a bit of research on intonation, on extraposed relative clauses, on focus and some other matters.
        I have also briefly looked into the difference between the use of demonstrative pronouns (independent ones) where personal pronouns would have been just as well.
        The initial hypothesis is that the demonstrative pronouns mark a story's protagonist (they are VIP markers).
        But I have a feeling that this is only part of the story behind its use.
        Hence the current research on demonstrative pronouns.

        <h3>Language study</h3>
        <p>Interested in Chechen? Here is some material available for learning Chechen:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="../elpash.html">Elpash</a>: learn the basics one letter at a time. The lessons are in English, there are exercises (with an answer sheet),
            and the stories (one per letter) come with a sound recording. This course is completely ready and available online.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="../gulam.html">Gulam</a>: this is an audio-focused 'comprehensible corpus'. A collection of audio-exercises 
            that focuses on: vocabulary learning (by pointing to items), physical response drills, grammar learning 
            (by taking one grammatical feature and applying it to multiple pictures in a picture book) and comprehensible-input stories.
            All the spoken text is also (becoming) available transcribed into (Cyrillic) Chechen, sometimes with accompanying IPA, where this is helpful.
            This series is under construction, since the transcription takes some time.
          </li>
          <li><b>Orthography</b>: This <a href="../che/ChechenOrthography.pdf">pdf</a> 
            explains the correspondence between the Chechen Cyrillic orthography and the Latin one that is used in e.g. the dictionary app.
            (If you're interested, this <a href="../che/ChechenPhonologyChapter.pdf">pdf</a> contains the whole chapter on Chechen phonology - preliminary version.)
          </li>
          <li><b>Dictionary</b>
            <ul>
              <li>app for <a href="../app/nl.ru.che.dict.apk">Android</a>, 
                <span style="color: darkred;"><b>beta-version</b></span> for <a href="#" title="https://testflight.apple.com/join/K5Mtb2Na" style="background-color: yellow;">iPhone</a></li>
              <li>browsing <a href="https://erwinkomen.ruhosting.nl/che/dict/lexicon/main.htm">online</a></li>
            </ul>
          
          </li>
          <li><b>Cesar</b>: a <a href="https://cesar.science.ru.nl">web application</a> to browse and search through syntactically annotated texts, including Chechen.</li>
          <li>
            <b>Keyboard</b>:
            Here is the <a href="../che/TheChechenR_keyboard.pdf">pdf description</a> of an adapted <b>Russian</b> keyboard.
            This keyboard can be installed by downloading the <a href="../che/chechenr.zip">compressed file</a>, unpacking it into a folder, and then double-clicking the <b>setup.exe</b> file.
            (You might want to first check it for viruses, since this is an executable.)
            If setup fails for some reason, it may still be possible to attempt a setup by using one of the three <code>.msi</code> files 
            (only one will be appropriate for your computer).
            <p>Note: you will be asked to confirm this installation as administrator by your computer.</p>
